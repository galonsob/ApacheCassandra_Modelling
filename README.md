# ApacheCassandra_Modelling
Small Project developed for the first stage of Udacity's Nanodegree: Data Engineering with Azure.

I carried out a small data modelling project in Python for Apache Cassandra. It consists of a small ETL pipeline to read the data, a brief wrangling through Pandas and the data modelling section 
with table creation and load in Apache Cassandra.
